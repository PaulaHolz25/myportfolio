    <h1>My work on gender neutral language</h1>
    <p>During my studies, I always came back to the topic of gender equality. Next to the concepts of intersectionality and postcultural feminism,
        gender gaps in the work field and in the german culture or the unequal research in the health field, I was also able to learn about the 
    effects of gender neutral language on children in primary school age. This is especially relevant in the german language as most nouns have 
a specific male and female form, which is simplified by the generic masculinum, which means that only the male form is used. However, studies have 
shown that using a gender-neutral form of job titles has a significant impact on elementary school girls. When professions are consistently presented 
in a gender-neutral way rather than in the generic masculine, girls in male-dominated fields perceive themselves as having a higher likelihood of success.
